"""Combined server (.mcpb / `uvx marketplaces-mcp-ru`) mounts every service.

The combined FastMCP is built by copying each service's already-registered
tools via FastMCP's internal tool manager (``_tool_manager._tools``). That
surface is private, so this test locks it: if an ``mcp`` upgrade moves it, the
combined tool count drops and this fails loudly instead of shipping an empty
Claude Desktop bundle. Tool names are namespaced per service, so the union is
exact — no collisions, nothing dropped.
